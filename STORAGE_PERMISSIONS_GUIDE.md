# Android Storage Permissions & File Download Guide

This guide explains the new storage permission system implemented for your Flutter app to handle file downloads properly on Android devices.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Modern Android Permission Handling
- **Android 13+ (API 33+)**: Uses granular media permissions (`READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`, `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO`, `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO`)
- **Android 11-12 (API 30-32)**: Uses `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` with fallback to regular storage permissions
- **Android 10 and below (API 29-)**: Uses traditional `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` and `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`

### 2. New Services Created

#### PermissionService (`lib/services/permission_service.dart`)
- Handles Android version-specific permission requests
- Provides methods to check and request storage permissions
- Automatically detects Android version and uses appropriate permissions

#### MobileDownloadService (`lib/services/mobile_download_service.dart`)
- Downloads files to the proper Downloads folder
- Shows Android notifications when files are downloaded
- Handles file name sanitization and error cases
- Opens downloaded files automatically

#### Updated JobService (`lib/services/jobs_service.dart`)
- Now uses the new permission services
- Properly handles different platforms (Web, Android, iOS)
- Better error handling and user feedback

### 3. Android Native Code
- Updated `MainActivity.kt` to handle download notifications
- Added FileProvider configuration for secure file sharing
- Creates notification channels for download notifications

### 4. User Experience Improvements
- Loading dialogs during download
- Permission explanation dialogs
- Success/error notifications with proper icons
- Option to open app settings if permissions are denied

## How It Works

### Permission Flow
1. User clicks download button
2. App checks if storage permissions are already granted
3. If not granted, shows explanation dialog
4. Requests appropriate permissions based on Android version
5. If granted, proceeds with download
6. If denied, shows guidance to enable in settings

### Download Flow
1. App requests storage permissions
2. Downloads file from server
3. Saves file to Downloads folder (or app directory as fallback)
4. Shows Android notification
5. Allows user to open file directly from notification

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `lib/services/permission_service.dart` - Permission handling
- `lib/services/mobile_download_service.dart` - File download utility
- `android/app/src/main/res/xml/file_paths.xml` - FileProvider configuration

### Modified Files
- `pubspec.yaml` - Added `device_info_plus` dependency
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Updated permissions and added FileProvider
- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/.../MainActivity.kt` - Added notification handling
- `lib/services/jobs_service.dart` - Updated to use new permission system
- `lib/screens/jobs_tab_screen.dart` - Enhanced download UI and error handling

## Features

### âœ… What Works Now
- Proper permission requests for all Android versions
- Files download to Downloads folder (visible in file manager)
- Download notifications with file opening capability
- Better user feedback during download process
- Graceful error handling with helpful messages
- Settings redirection for denied permissions

### ðŸ”„ Permission Handling
- Automatically detects Android version
- Uses appropriate permissions for each Android version
- Provides fallback options when permissions are denied
- Shows helpful dialogs explaining why permissions are needed

### ðŸ“± User Experience
- Loading indicators during download
- Success notifications with file location info
- Error messages with actionable solutions
- Direct file opening from notifications

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test on Different Android Versions**:
   - Android 13+ (API 33+) - Test granular media permissions
   - Android 11-12 - Test MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
   - Android 10 and below - Test legacy storage permissions

2. **Permission Scenarios**:
   - First time download (no permissions granted)
   - Permission denied by user
   - Permission granted but file save fails
   - Re-download after permission revoked

3. **File Management**:
   - Check files appear in Downloads folder
   - Verify files can be opened from notification
   - Test with different file sizes
   - Ensure proper cleanup on app uninstall

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Permission Denied**: Guide users to app settings to manually enable permissions
2. **File Not Found**: Check if Downloads directory is accessible
3. **Notification Not Showing**: Verify notification permissions are enabled
4. **File Won't Open**: Ensure FileProvider is properly configured

### Debug Steps
1. Check Android version and expected permission type
2. Verify permission status in app settings
3. Check if file was actually saved to expected location
4. Test notification channel creation
5. Verify FileProvider authorities match app package name

## Next Steps

For production deployment:
1. Test thoroughly on various Android devices and versions
2. Consider adding file size limits for downloads
3. Implement download progress indicators for large files
4. Add option to choose download location
5. Consider implementing download queue for multiple files

## Dependencies Added
- `device_info_plus: ^9.1.0` - For Android version detection

The implementation is now ready for testing and should provide a much better user experience for file downloads on Android devices!
